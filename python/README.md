### python interpreter location on windows: 
`C:\Users\tanma\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\python.exe`

### All/Some filenames in pycharm become red:  
This is because, pycharm uses version control, if you open pycharm somewhere there is a file not supported by pycharm in your folder,  
It will lead to reddening of the filenames, to resolve, you either **commit that file if not already done automatically by adding it to the  
version control system(vcs), or if the file is not supported, you have to open that file in pycharm and install plugins to support it.**
